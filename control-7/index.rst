CIS Control 7: Email and Web Browser Protections
=======================================================

Minimize the attack surface and the opportunities for attackers to manipulate human behavior
through their interaction with web browsers and email systems.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry and attack because of their
technical complexity, flexibility, and their direct interaction with users and with other systems and
websites. Content can be crafted to entice or spoof users into taking actions that greatly increase
risk and allow introduction of malicious code, loss of valuable data, and other attacks. Since
these applications are the main means that users interact with untrusted environments, these are
potential targets for both code exploitation and social engineering.
