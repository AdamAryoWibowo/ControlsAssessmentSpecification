Appendix A: Global Variable Listing
===================================

Several observables or artifacts specified by this document are used across two or more Sub-Controls, and from time to time across two or more top-level Controls. We have made every attempt to identify such global variables and list them here in the table below.

Global variables are denoted by a concatenation of :code:`GV` and a positive integer. For example, the Hardware Asset Inventory is identified by :code:`GV1`. The table below provides each global variable's identifier, name, description, source Sub-Control (when applicable), and any relevant notes.

We encourage you to report any missed global variables by creating a GitHub issue in our publicly available repository TODO: LINK.
