1.3: Utilize an Active Discovery Tool
=========================================================
Utilize an active discovery tool to identify assets connected to the enterpriseâ€™s network. Configure the active discovery tool to execute daily, or more frequently.

Dependencies
------------
* Safeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV1`: Enterprise asset inventory
#. The list of active discovery tool(s) used by the enterprise
#. List consisting of the union from scan results conducted using all active asset discovery tool(s) within the enterprise (discovered assets).
#. Timeframe between two active asset discovery tool scans.
#. :code:`GV3`: Configuration Standard

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
#. The asset discovery tools on the provided list are active asset discovery tools, as opposed to passive asset discovery tools (verification of this is not performed during the following operations).

Operations
----------
#. Identify enterprise assets not discovered by the active discovery tools by comparing Input 1 and Input 3 (M2).
#. Identify the configurations for active asset discovery tools that interface with :code:`GV1` by using :code:`GV3`
#. Using the configuration information in :code:`GV3`, check the approved configurations to verify that the tools are capable of interfacing with the asset inventory to make automatic updates. 
	#. Enumerate those tools that are compliant (M3)
	#. Enumerate those that are not compliant (M4).

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of all discovered assets from Input 3
* M2 = Count of undiscovered assets
* M3 = Count of properly configured tools
* M4 = Count of improperly configured tools
* M5 = Count of Input 2
* M6 = Count of :code:`GV1`
* M7 = Timeframe in hours for Input 4

Metrics
-------
* If M7 is greater than 24 hours, then this safeguard is measured at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
* If M5 is 0, then this safeguard is measured at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
