Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
------
#. :code:`GV1`: Hardware Asset Inventory
#. :code:`GV2`: Count of Hardware Asset Inventory

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint in the hardware asset inventory, examine the endpoint's client authentication certificate configuration noting appropriate (becomes M1) and inappropriate (becomes M2) configurations

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of appropriately configured endpoints (operation 2)
* M2 = List of inappropriately configured endpoints (operation 2)
* M3 = Count of appropriately configured hardware devices (count of M1)
* M4 = Count of inappropriately configured hardware devices (count of M2)
