Draft

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
------
#. The list of endpoints

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate hardware devices (physical and virtual) from the endpoint inventory
#. For each hardware device, examine device client authentication certificate configuration noting appropriate and inappropriate configurations

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of hardware devices (operation 1)
* M2 = List of appropriately configured hardware devices (operation 2)
* M3 = List of inappropriately configured hardware devices (operation 2)
* M4 = Count of hardware devices (count of M1)
* M5 = Count of appropriately configured hardware devices (count of M2)
* M6 = Count of inappropriately configured hardware devices (count of M3)
