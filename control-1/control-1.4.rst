1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
======================================
Maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all technology assets with the potential to store or process information. This inventory shall include all assets, whether connected to the organizationâ€™s network or not.

.. list-table::
	:header-rows: 1

	* - Asset Type 
	  - Security Function
	  - Implementation Groups
	* - Devices
	  - Identify
	  - 1, 2, 3

Status
------
Draft

Assumptions
-----------
* The list of devices (M2) is known to the organization, 
* The max asset discovery time (M5) is known to the organization, and 
* M4 is known since the asset is being connected to the network

Measures
--------

* M1 = number of assets discovered
* M2 = total number of assets (given)
* M3 = time asset discovered
* M4 = time asset appeared (given)
* M5 = Max time discovery (given)

Metrics
-------

Coverage (Quality Measure)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table:: 

	* - **Question**
	  - What percentage of assets discovered on the network are accounted for in the organization's asset inventory?
	* - **Answer**
	  - A positive percentage value greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 100%  A value of "0" would indicate that none of the discovered assets have been inventoried; a value of "100" indicates that all assets connected to the organization's network are accounted for in the asset inventory.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M1/M2) * 100%`

Freshness (Time to Discover)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - How long does it take for an organization to discover a new asset on its network?
	* - **Answer**
	  - The "freshness" metric is a positive decimal value that is greater than or equal to zero. A value of "0" indicates hypothetical instant detection.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`((M3-M4) / M5)`
