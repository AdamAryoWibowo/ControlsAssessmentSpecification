Status
------
Draft

Inputs
-----------
#. List of endpoints to scan (assumed capable of hosting firewall/port-filtering software)
#. A policy (or set of policies, potentially individually per endpoint) indicating the ports that are allowed to be open

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint, retrieve the firewall policy
#. For each firewall policy, enumerate both the ports which allow communication, and any configuration of a default deny rule (could that be a default?)

Measures
--------
* M1 = For an endpoint's firewall policy, 1 if all of the described open ports are in the allowed list
* M2 = For an endpoint's firewall policy, 1 if a default deny rule exists and is enforced.
* M3 = Total number of endpoints
* M4 = Logical AND of M1 and M2 for that endpoint
