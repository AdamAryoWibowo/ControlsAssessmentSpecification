Status
------
Draft

Dependencies
------------
* Subcontrol 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Subcontrol 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
-----------
#. List of endpoints to scan (assumed capable of hosting firewall/port-filtering software)
#. A policy (or set of policies, potentially individually per endpoint) indicating the ports that are allowed to be open

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint, retrieve the firewall policy
#. For each firewall policy, enumerate both the ports which allow communication, and any configuration of a default deny rule (could that be a default?)

Measures
--------
* M1(i) = (For each endpoint "i") 1 if all of the described open ports are in the allowed list; 0 otherwise
* M2(i) = (For each endpoint "i") 1 if a default deny rule exists and is enforced; 0 otherwise
* M3 = Total number of endpoints
* M4(i) = (For each endpoint "i") The logical :code:`M1(i) AND M2(i)`

Metrics
-------
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - What is the ratio of correctly configured endpoints to the total number of endpoints?
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(SUM from i=1..M3 (M4(i))) / M3`
