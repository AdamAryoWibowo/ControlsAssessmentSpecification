Inputs
-----------
#. List of authorized remote hosts

Operations
----------
#. For each host in the list of authorized remote hosts, check the remote access software configuration:
	#. Encrypted connections are required
	#. Multi-factor authentication is required

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of authorized remote hosts
* M2 = Count of authorized remote hosts with encryption required
* M3 = Count of authorized remote hosts with multi-factor authentication required
* M4 = Count of authorized remote hosts with both encryption and multi-factor authentication required
