Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 12.1: Maintain an Inventory of Network Boundaries

Inputs
-----------
#. List of network monitoring systems
#. List of network boundaries

Operations
----------
#. For each network monitoring system:
	#. Retrieve configuration
	#. Check configuration for recording
	#. Enumerate network boundaries covered

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of network monitoring systems (from Input 1)
* M2 = List of misconfigured network monitoring systems
* M3 = Count of misconfigured network monitoring systems
* M4 = Count of network boundaries (from Input 2)
* M5 = List of network boundaries covered by network monitoring systems
* M6 = Count of network boundaries covered by network monitoring systems
* M7 = List of network boundaries not covered by network monitoring systems
* M8 = Count of network boundaries not covered by network monitoring systems 

Metrics
