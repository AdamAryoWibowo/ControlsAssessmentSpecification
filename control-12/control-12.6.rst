Draft

Dependencies
------------
* Subcontrol 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Subcontrol 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Subcontrol 12.1: Maintain an Inventory of Network Boundaries

Inputs
-----------
#. List of network boundaries
#. List of IDS sensors

Operations
----------
#. For each IDS sensor, enumerate network boundaries covered

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of network boundaries
* M2 = Count of IDS sensors
* M3 = Count of network boundaries covered by IDS sensors

Metrics
