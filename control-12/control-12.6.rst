12.6: Deploy Network-Based IDS Sensors
=========================================================
Deploy network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) sensors to look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems at each of the organizationâ€™s network boundaries.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 12.1: Maintain an Inventory of Network Boundaries

Inputs
-----------
#. List of network boundaries
#. List of IDS sensors

Operations
----------
#. For each IDS sensor, enumerate network boundaries covered

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of network boundaries (from Input 1)
* M2 = Count of IDS sensors (from Input 2)
* M4 = List of network boundaries covered by IDS sensors
* M5 = Count of network boundaries covered by IDS sensors
* M6 = List of network boundaries not covered by IDS sensors
* M7 = Count of network boundaries not covered by IDS sensors

Metrics
