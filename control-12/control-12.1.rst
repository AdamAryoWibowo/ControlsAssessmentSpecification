Draft

Inputs
-----------
#. An inventory of expected boundary devices (M1)

Operations
----------
#. Utilize a discovery tool or process to examine the network topology to collect the list of devices considered boundary devices (M2).
#. Evaluate the complement of Input 1 and Operation 1 to get the list of non-inventoried boundary devices (M3).

Measures
--------
* M1 = The number of expected network boundary devices
* M2 = The number of discovered network boundary devices
* M3 = Number of non-inventoried boundary devices
