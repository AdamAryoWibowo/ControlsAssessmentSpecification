CIS Control 10: Data Recovery Capabilities
=======================================================

The processes and tools used to properly back up critical information with a proven methodology
for timely recovery of it.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

When attackers compromise machines, they often make significant changes to configurations
and software. Sometimes attackers also make subtle alterations of data stored on compromised
machines, potentially jeopardizing organizational effectiveness with polluted information. When
the attackers are discovered, it can be extremely difficult for organizations without a trustworthy
data recovery capability to remove all aspects of the attackerâ€™s presence on the machine.
