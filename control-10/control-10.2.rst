Status

Draft

Dependencies
------------
* Subcontrol 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Subcontrol 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of "key systems" identified by the organization
#. The organization's backup/imaging configuration policy

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Backup software (either OS or 3d party) is installed and appropriately configured on "key systems" identified in Input 1

Operations
----------
#. Compare each "key system"'s backup configuration with available configuration policy.

Measures
--------
* M1(i) = (For each key system "i") 1 if "key system" backup configuration policy meets policy requirements; 0 otherwise
* M2 = The total number of endpoints defined as "key systems"


Metrics

Coverage
^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - What percentage of key systems are successfully backed up as a complete system?
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(SUM of M1 from i=1..M2 (M1(i))) / M2`
