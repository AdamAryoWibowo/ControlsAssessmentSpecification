Inputs
-----------
#. The list of "key systems" identified by the organization
#. The organization's backup/imaging configuration policy

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Backup software (either OS or 3d party) is installed and appropriately configured on "key systems" identified in Input 1

Operations
----------
#. Compare each "key system"'s backup configuration with available configuration policy.

Measures
--------
* M1 = 1 if "key system" backup configuration policy meets policy requirements; 0 otherwise
* M2 = The total number of endpoints defined as "key systems"
