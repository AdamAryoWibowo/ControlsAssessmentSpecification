Dependencies

* Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV27`: Assets capable of supporting logging
#. :code:`GV26`: Enterprise's audit log management process

Assumptions
----------
#. It is assumed that if the an asset is properly configured to meet the retention policy, that would include log rotation, maximum storage size, etc.

Operations
----------
#. For each asset in :code:`GV27` collect the asset's logging configuration 
#. Compare the output of Operation 1 and the retention portion of :code:`G26`
	#. Identify and enumerate assets configured to comply with the retention portion of the process (M2)
	#. Identify and enumerate assets not configured to comply with the retention portion of the process (M3)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of :code:`GV27` assets capable of supporting logging
* M2 = Count of assets properly configured to meet retention requirements
* M3 = Count of assets not properly configured to meet retention requirements
