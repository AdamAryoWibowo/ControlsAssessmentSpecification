CIS Control 8: Malware Defenses
=======================================================

Control the installation, spread, and execution of malicious code at multiple points in the
enterprise, while optimizing the use of automation to enable rapid updating of defense, data
gathering, and corrective action.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Malicious software is an integral and dangerous aspect of Internet threats, as it is designed to
attack your systems, devices, and your data. It is fast-moving, fast-changing, and enters through
any number of points like end-user devices, email attachments, web pages, cloud services, user
actions, and removable media. Modern malware is designed to avoid defenses, and attack or
disable them.

Malware defenses must be able to operate in this dynamic environment through large-scale
automation, rapid updating, and integration with processes like incident response. They must
also be deployed at multiple possible points of attack to detect, stop the movement of, or control
the execution of malicious software. Enterprise endpoint security suites provide administrative
features to verify that all defenses are active and current on every managed system.
