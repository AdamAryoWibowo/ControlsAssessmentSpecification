==============================================================================================
Establish and maintain an isolated instance of recovery data. Example implementations include, version controlling backup destinations through offline, cloud, or off-site systems or services.

Dependencies
------------
* Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory
* Safeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV33`: Assets that are in-scope for automated backups
#. :code:`GV34`: Assets with authorized backup software installed
#. :code:`GV3`: Configuration standards

Assumptions
----------
#. Configuration for backups will contain information about destination of backups

Operations
----------
#. For each asset in Input 2 :code:`GV34`, use configuration standards in :code:`GV3` to check destination of backups
	#. Identify and enumerate assets properly configured to send backups to an isolated instance (M2)
	#. Identify and enumerate assets not properly configured to send backups to an isolated instance (M3)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of Input 1 :code:`GV33`
* M2 = Count of assets with backups sent to an isolated instance 
* M3 = Count of assets with backups not sent to an isolated instance

Metrics
