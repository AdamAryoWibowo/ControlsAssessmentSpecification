Why the CIS Controls Work: Methodology and Contributors
=======================================================

The CIS Controls are informed by actual attacks and effective defenses and reflect the combined
knowledge of experts from every part of the ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals);
with every role (threat responders and analysts, technologists, vulnerability-finders, tool makers,
solution providers, defenders, users, policy-makers, auditors, etc.); and within many sectors
(government, power, defense, finance, transportation, academia, consulting, security, IT) who
have banded together to create, adopt, and support the Controls.
Top experts from organizations pooled their extensive first-hand
knowledge from defending against actual cyber-attacks to evolve the
consensus list of Controls, representing the best defensive techniques
to prevent or track them. This ensures that the CIS Controls are the
most effective and specific set of technical measures available to detect,
prevent, respond, and mitigate damage from the most common to the
most advanced of those attacks.

The CIS Controls are not limited to blocking the initial compromise of
systems, but also address detecting already-compromised machines
and preventing or disrupting attackers’ follow-on actions. The defenses
identified through these Controls deal with reducing the initial attack
surface by hardening device configurations, identifying compromised
machines to address long-term threats inside an organization’s
network, disrupting attackers’ command-and-control of implanted
malicious code, and establishing an adaptive, continuous defense, and
response capability that can be maintained and improved.

The five critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system as reflected
in the CIS Controls are:

**Offense informs defense**: Use knowledge of actual attacks that have
compromised systems to provide the foundation to continually learn
from these events to build effective, practical defenses. Include only
those controls that can be shown to stop known real-world attacks.

**Prioritization**: Invest first in Controls that will provide the greatest risk
reduction and protection against the most dangerous threat actors
and that can be feasibly implemented in your computing environment.
The CIS Implementation Groups discussed below are a great place for
organizations to start identifying relevant Sub-Controls.

**Measurements and Metrics**: Establish common metrics to provide a
shared language for executives, IT specialists, auditors, and security
officials to measure the effectiveness of security measures within
an organization so that required adjustments can be identified and
implemented quickly.

**Continuous diagnostics and mitigation**: Carry out continuous
measurement to test and validate the effectiveness of current security
measures and to help drive the priority of next steps.

**Automation**: Automate defenses so that organizations can achieve
reliable, scalable, and continuous measurements of their adherence to
the Controls and related metrics.
