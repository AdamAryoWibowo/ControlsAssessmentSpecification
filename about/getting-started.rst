Getting Started
===============

The CIS Controls are a relatively small number of prioritized, well-vetted, and supported security
actions that organizations can take to assess and improve their current security state. They also
change the discussion from “What should my enterprise do?” to “What should we ALL be doing?”
to improve security across a broad scale.

But this is not a one-size-fits-all solution, in either content or priority. You must still understand
what is critical to your business, data, systems, networks, and infrastructures, and you must
consider the adversarial actions that could impact your ability to be successful in the business or
operation. Even a relatively small number of Controls cannot be executed all at once, so you will
need to develop a plan for assessment, implementation, and process management.
