About
=============

The CIS Controls™ are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set
of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks. The
CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience
as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices. The experts who
develop the CIS Controls come from a wide range of sectors including retail, manufacturing,
healthcare, education, government, defense, and others.

We are at a fascinating point in the evolution of what we now call cyber defense. Massive data
losses, theft of intellectual property, credit card breaches, identity theft, threats to our privacy,
denial of service – these have become a way of life for all of us in cyberspace.

As defenders we have access to an extraordinary array of security tools and technology,
security standards, training and classes, certifications, vulnerability databases, guidance, best
practices, catalogs of security controls, and countless security checklists, benchmarks, and
recommendations. To help us understand the threat, we have seen the emergence of threat
information feeds, reports, tools, alert services, standards, and threat sharing frameworks. To top
it all off, we are surrounded by security requirements, risk management frameworks, compliance
regimes, regulatory mandates, and so forth. There is no shortage of information available to
security practitioners on what they should do to secure their infrastructure.

But all of this technology, information, and oversight has become a veritable “Fog of More” –
competing options, priorities, opinions, and claims that can paralyze or distract an enterprise
from vital action. Business complexity is growing, dependencies are expanding, users are
becoming more mobile, and the threats are evolving. New technology brings us great benefits,
but it also means that our data and applications are now distributed across multiple locations,
many of which are not within our organization’s infrastructure. In this complex, interconnected
world, no enterprise can think of its security as a standalone problem.

So how can we as a community – the community-at-large, as well as within industries, sectors,
partnerships, and coalitions – band together to establish priority of action, support each other,
and keep our knowledge and technology current in the face of a rapidly evolving problem and
an apparently infinite number of possible solutions? What are the most critical areas we need
to address and how should an enterprise take the first step to mature their risk management
program? Rather than chase every new exceptional threat and neglect the fundamentals, how
can we get on track with a roadmap of fundamentals, and guidance to measure and improve?
Which defensive steps have the greatest value?

These are the kinds of issues that led to and now drive the CIS Controls. They started as a grassroots
activity to cut through the “Fog of More” and focus on the most fundamental and valuable
actions that every enterprise should take. And **value** here is determined by knowledge and data –
the ability to prevent, alert, and respond to the attacks that are plaguing enterprises today.

Led by CIS®, the CIS Controls have been matured by an international community of individuals and
institutions that:

* Share insight into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and translate that into classes of defensive action;
* Document stories of adoption and share tools to solve problems;
* Track the evolution of threats, the capabilities of adversaries, and current vectors of intrusions;
* Map the CIS Controls to regulatory and compliance frameworks and bring collective priority and focus to them;
* Share tools, working aids, and translations; and
* Identify common problems (like initial assessment and implementation roadmaps) and solve them as a community.

These activities ensure that the CIS Controls are not just another list of good things to do, but
a prioritized, highly focused set of actions that have a community support network to make
them implementable, usable, scalable, and compliant with all industry or government security
requirements.
