16.5: Use Up-to-Date and Trusted Third-Party Software Components
====================================================================
Use up-to-date and trusted third-party software components. When possible, choose established and proven frameworks and libraries that provide adequate security.Â Acquire these components from trusted sources or evaluate the software for vulnerabilities before use.

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV47`: Inventory of Third-Party Software Components 


Operations
----------
#. For each software component in Input 1 :code:`GV47`, determine whether the latest component is being used
	#. Identify and enumerate software components that are up-to-date (M2)
	#. Identify and enumerate software components that are not up-to-date (M3)
#. For each software component identified in Operaion 1.1, determine whether they are explicitly trusted by the enterprise
	#. Identify and enumerate software components that are trusted by the enterprise (M4)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of Input 1
* M2 = Count of software components that are up-to-date
* M3 = Count of software components that are not up-to-date
* M4 = Count of software components that are up to date and trusted
