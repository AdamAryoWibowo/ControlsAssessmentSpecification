.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - What percentage of authorized software libraries are allowed to be loaded per application whitelisting protocols?
	* - **Answer**
	  - The calculation of this metric yields a percentage, from 0 to 100%, indicating the ratio of software libraries that are whitelisted to the total number of software libraries.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M1/M2) * 100`
