2.2: Ensure Software is Supported by Vendor
===========================================
Ensure that only software applications or operating systems currently supported and receiving vendor updates are added to the organizationâ€™s authorized software inventory.  Unsupported software should be tagged as unsupported in the inventory system.

Status
------
In Development

Inputs
------
#. The assumption is that a list of all authorized software is available, and that this list indicates whether or not the software is currently supported by the vendor.

Operations
----------
#. 

Measures
--------
* M = The list of software maintained in the software asset inventory (See control 2.1)
* M1 = # of unsupported software
* M2 = # of supported software
* M(U) = 1 if a software asset U is unsupported, but tracked as supported in M
* M(S) = 1 if a software asset S is supported, but tracked as unsupported in M

Metrics

Supported Software Accuracy

	* - **Question**
	  - | This metric is intended to determine the ratio of software tracked as supported
	    | in the software inventory, but is not supported by the vendor.
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation of this metric is made by summing the M(U) value for each software
	    | asset tracked in M, and the associated ratio of that sum to the # of unsupported
	    | software in the enterprise (M1).

	  - :code:`(SUM of all M(U) for all U) / M1`

Unsupported Software Accuracy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - | This metric is intended to determine the ratio of software tracked as unsupported
	    | in the software inventory, but is still supported by the vendor.
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation of this metric is made by summing the M(S) value for each software
	    | asset tracked in M, and the associated ratio of that sum to the # of supported software
	    | in the enterprise (M2).
