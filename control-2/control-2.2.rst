2.2: Ensure Software is Supported by Vendor
===========================================
Ensure that only software applications or operating systems currently supported and receiving vendor updates are added to the organizationâ€™s authorized software inventory.  Unsupported software should be tagged as unsupported in the inventory system.

Status

Draft

Inputs
------
#. The authorized software list with a notation of "supported" or "unsupported" for each entry.
#. Access to an authoritative source of information indicating supported/unsupported details by product.

Operations
----------
#. For each entry in Input 1, perform a lookup in Input 2 to verify.
#. For each entry in Input 1 labeled "supported", perform a lookup in Input 2.  From these lookups, note the list of authorized software labeled "supported" but are actually not supported based on the authoritative source lookup.
#. For each entry in Input 1 labeled "unsupported", perform a lookup in Input 2.  From these lookups, note the list of authorized software labeled "unsupported" but are actually supported based on the authoritative source lookup.

Measures
--------
* M1 = # of items in Input 1 that are unsupported (combination of Operation 1 results and those initially marked as unsupported in Input 1)
* M2 = Total # of authorized software (from Input 1)
* M3 = The number of items from Input 1 labeled "supported" but are actually not supported (from Operation 2)
* M4 = The number of items from Input 1 labeled "unsupported" but are actually supported (from Operation 3)

Metrics
-------

Percentage of Unsupported Software in Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - | What percentage of authorized software in use is unsupported?
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation of this metric is determined by the ratio of 
	    | unsupported software to the total authorized software in use.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M2 - M1) / M2`

Rate of False Positives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - | What percentage of software listed as supported is actually not supported?
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation of this metric is determined by the ratio of software labeled
	    |  "supported" but found to be unsupported, to the total authorized software in use.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M2 - M3) / M2`

Rate of False Negatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - | What percentage of software listed as unsupported is actually supported?
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation of this metric is determined by the ratio of software labeled
	    |  "unsupported" but found to be supported, to the total authorized software in use.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M2 - M4) / M2`
