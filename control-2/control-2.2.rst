===========================================

Status

Draft

Assumptions
-----------
The assumption is that a list of all authorized software is available, and that this list indicates whether or not the software is currently supported by the vendor.

Measures
--------
* M1 = # of authorized software
* M2 = # of tracked software (tagged as supported or unsupported)
* M3 = # of unsupported software in authorized list

Metrics
-------
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - What percentage of software installed in the enterprise are accounted for, as either supported or unsupported, in the organization's software asset inventory?
	* - **Answer**
	  - Ideally, all software installed in the enterprise should be accounted for, and tagged as either supported or unsupported.  When all authorized software is tracked (when M1 == M2), this metric illustrates the percentage of software tagged as unsupported.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`((M1 - M3) / M1)`
