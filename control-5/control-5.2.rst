5.2: Maintain Secure Images
=========================================================
Maintain secure images or templates for all systems in the enterprise based on the organizationâ€™s approved configuration standards.  Any new system deployment or existing system that becomes compromised should be imaged using one of those images or templates.

Status
------
Draft

Inputs
------
#. The list of the organization's approved configuration standards, per implementation of sub-control 5.1
#. The inventory of systems
#. The mapping of systems in the inventory to any secure configurations that should be applied. This input assumes that multiple configurations could apply to a single system in the inventory.
#. The inventory of images

Operations
----------
#. For each system in the inventory, determine the list of systems which have had an image taken and the list of systems without a corresponding image.
#. For each system with a corresponding image, compare the image's configuration with the configuration standard(s) mapped to that system.

Measures
--------
* M1 = The number of systems in the inventory
* M2 = The number of systems with a corresponding image taken
* M3 = 1 if an image is configured according to the standards mapped to that system; 0 otherwise.

Metrics
-------

Image Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of systems with a corresponding image taken to the total number of inventoried
	    | systems
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`M2 / M1`

Configuration Coverage
