Status
------
In Development

Inputs
------
#. 

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Documented, standard security configuration standards exist per control 5.1
* Images/templates for a given system could encompass one-to-many security configuration standards, i.e. an operating system configuration standard plus a browser configuration standard

Operations
----------
#. 

Measures
--------
* M1 = # of systems with image taken
* M2 = # of total system
* M3 = # of system with approved configuration

Metrics

Coverage (Quality Measure)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - Determine the percentage of total systems from which an image has been taken.
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation will yield a percentage, from 0 to 100, indicating the ratio of
	    | total systems to those with images taken.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M1/M2) * 100`

Configuration Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Question**
	  - | Determine the percentage of total systems to which approved configurations have
	    | been applied.
	* - **Answer**
	  - | The calculation will yield a percentage, from 0 to 100, indicating the ratio of total
	    | systems to those with approved configurations applied.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M3/M2) * 100`
