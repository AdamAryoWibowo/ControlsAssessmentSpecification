15.4: Ensure Service Provider Contracts Include Security Requirements
=========================================================
Ensure service provider contracts include security requirements. Example requirements may include minimum security program requirements, security incident and/or data breach notification and response, data encryption requirements, and data disposal commitments. These security requirements must be consistent with the enterpriseâ€™s service provider management policy. Review service provider contracts annually to ensure contracts are not missing security requirements.

Dependencies
------------
* Safeguard 15.1: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Providers
* Safeguard 15.2: Establish and Maintain a Service Provider Management Policy

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV44`: Service Provider Inventory List
#. :code:`GV45`: Service Provider Management Policy
#. Date of last update or review of contracts


Operations
----------
#. Use Input 2 :code:`GV45` to determine if the enterprise policy includes security program requirements for service providers
	#. If the security requirements exist, M1 = 1
	#. If the security requirements do not exist, M1 = 0 
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV44` to determine if each listed service provider has a contract
	#. Identify and enumerate service providers with contracts (M3)
	#. Identify and enumerate service providers without contracts (M4)
#. For each service provider with a contract identified in Operation 2.1, compare the date from input 3 to current date and capture timeframe in months
	#. Identify and enumerate service providers whose contract has been reviewed within twelve months or less (M5)
	#. Identify and enumerate service providers whose contract has been reviewed outside the twelve month window (M6)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Output of Operation 1
* M2 = Count of service providers in inventory
* M3 = Count of service providers with contracts
* M4 = Count of service providers without contracts
* M5 = Count of service providers with up to date contracts
* M6 = Count of service providers without out dated contracts

Metrics
-------
* If M1 is a 0, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
