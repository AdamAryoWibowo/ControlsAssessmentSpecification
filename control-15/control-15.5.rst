15.5: Assess Service Providers
=========================================================
Assess service providers consistent with the enterpriseâ€™s service provider management policy. Assessment scope may vary based on classification(s), and may include review of standardized assessment reports, such as Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) and Payment Card Industry (PCI) Attestation of Compliance (AoC), customized questionnaires, or other appropriately rigorous processes. Reassess service providers annually, at a minimum, or with new and renewed contracts.

#. :code:`GV45`: Service Provider Management Policy

Operations

	#. If the assessment scope exist, M1 = 1
	#. If the assessment scope does not exist, M1 = 0 
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV44` to determine if each listed service provider has monitoring guidance included in the policy
	#. Identify and enumerate service providers with monitoring guidance (M3)
	#. Identify and enumerate service providers without monitoring guidance (M4)

Measures
