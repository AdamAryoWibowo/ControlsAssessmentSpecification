CIS Control 15: Wireless Access Control
=======================================================

The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct the secure use of wireless local area
networks (WLANs), access points, and wireless client systems.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Major thefts of data have been initiated by attackers who have gained wireless access to
organizations from outside the physical building, bypassing organizationsâ€™ security perimeters
by connecting wirelessly to access points inside the organization. Wireless clients accompanying
travelers are infected on a regular basis through remote exploitation while on public wireless
networks found in airports and cafes. Such exploited systems are then used as backdoors when
they are reconnected to the network of a target organization. Other organizations have reported
the discovery of unauthorized wireless access points on their networks, planted and sometimes
hidden for unrestricted access to an internal network. Because they do not require direct physical
connections, wireless devices are a convenient vector for attackers to maintain long-term access
into a target environment.
